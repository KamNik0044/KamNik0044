### Hi there, I am KamranðŸ‘‹

I got my start at McDonaldâ€™s and then transitioned into the tech world for fresh adventures. I enrolled in a 10-month coding bootcamp to enhance my skills and broaden my knowledge. Currently, Iâ€™m on the lookout for a company with a friendly workplace and opportunities for my career growth. Iâ€™m driven to continuously better myself. Beyond my job, I love watching and playing football, reading, and hanging out with friends.
